# MX-Frontend
A solution to the "Developers test" after applying for a job. I chose the Frontend part because that's the area I'm the most passionate about. Here I used PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery. I used PHP session to store some data as e.g. login and the note content.

I enjoyed having the option to freely design and setup the solution as I wanted to, but I had some difficulties coming up with a cool design idea because I immediately thought "Post-Its" when reading the "Note Taking Webpage Exercise" title. I'm sure I could have come up with a more challenging and awesome design, if I had not been stuck with the "Post-Its" idea/image in my head. But at least it's simple and not something over the top.

As I've written before, I used PHP sessions to store some data. When you log in on my webpage, it stores the username and displays it to the user (on the Homepage). And when you submit a note, it stores that data too. I know it's not the best storage use since the note data is removed when you leave the homepage and return, but I think it's sufficient enough to show the functioning of a Frontend note-taking webpage (without the Backend). 

It was a bit challenging not being able to use Bootstrap and frameworks like that - like I'm used to - but I ended up finding some help on W3Schools, which made it possible to use a grid-ish system like Bootstrap, but without a framework. This way I could structure the content on the webpage better than I would if I hadn't had a kind of grid system. 

I used the theme "gaming" for my solution since it's one of my interests and something I like to do in my sparetime. It made sense for me to use it as a theme for the solution.

I've written some comments in my code to describe what some of it does and I've also added links in the comment, where I've used help from Stackoverflow etc.
